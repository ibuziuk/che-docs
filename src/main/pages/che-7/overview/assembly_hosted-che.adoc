NOTE: Once started workspace can be used for an unlimited period of time. However, if there are no interactions with IDE workspace will be gracefully stopped.

- Ephemeral by default

NOTE: In the ephemeral mode workspace has no PVC attached, which means that all changes to the source code will be lost when the workspace is stopped unless they are pushed to a source code repository. This is done in order to improve the performance of a workspace startup and file system operations inside the IDE. User can disable ephemeral mode using the dedicated toggle during the workspace creation process from the "User Dashboard".

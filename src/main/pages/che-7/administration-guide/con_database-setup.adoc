PostgreSQL database is used for persisting data about the state of {prod-short} and contains vital information about the user accounts, workspaces, preferences, ssh keys etc.

By default, {prod-short} operator creates and manages a database deployment. 

However, {prod-short} operator does not support the full lifecycle capabilities like backups and recovery. For business-critical setup, it is recommended to configure an external database with the following disaster recovery options:

* High Availability (HA)
* Point In Time Recovery (PITR)

External PostgreSQL instance can be set up on-premises or via cloud services like RDS, which allows deploying production databases in a Multi-Availability Zone configuration for a resilient disaster recovery strategy with both daily and on-demand snapshots.
 The recommended configuration, in this case, is the following:

----
Instance class: db.t2.small
vCPU: 1
RAM: 2GB
Multi-az: True, 2 replicas
Engine version: 9.6.11
TLS: Enabled
Automated backups: Enabled (30 Days)
----

An external database is configured via the `externalDb: true` property in the {prod-short} Custom Resource (in this case the operator skips deploying a database, and passes connection details of existing DB to {prod-short} server using `chePostgresHostName`, `chePostgresPort`, `chePostgresUser`, `chePostgresPassword`, `chePostgresDb` parameters).
